# Cat-and-Dog-Image-Classification-using-CNN
This repository contains a deep learning project for classifying images of cats and dogs using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Keras and TensorFlow. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Organizes and standardizes image data for training and validation.
CNN Model: Builds a CNN model for binary classification.
Training and Evaluation: Trains the model and evaluates its performance on the validation set.
Visualization: Plots training history and visualizes predictions.
Requirements:
Python 3.x
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
tqdm
OpenCV
scikit-learn
TensorFlow
Keras
seaborn
Files:
train: Directory containing training images of cats and dogs.
test1: Directory containing test images.
trainvalidfull4keras: Directory structure for training and validation sets.
Usage:
Load Dataset: Ensure the dataset is organized with separate directories for training and validation images.
Preprocess Data: Use the provided script to preprocess and organize the data.
Train the Model: Train the CNN model using the training data.
Evaluate and Visualize: Evaluate the model on the validation data and visualize the results.
